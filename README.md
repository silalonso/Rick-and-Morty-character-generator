# :sparkles: Rick and Morty character generator :sparkles:

This is my Rick and Morty character generator.<br />
.

Try it here : [Rick and Morty](https://silalonso.github.io/modulo-3-evaluacion-final-silalonso/)

![This is how the app looks like](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/silalonso/modulo-3-evaluacion-final-silalonso/master/src/images/pokedex.jpg)

## How does it work?

The exercise consists of developing a web page with a list of Rick and Morty characters, which
you can filter by name.

First we paint on the screen a list of 20 characters, whose data we have obtained from: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Adalab/rick-y-morty/master/data/rick-y-morty.json <br />

Then I've added an input to the interface, so that when you write a name, only the characters whose name contains the written letters(in that same order) remain visible.<br />
No distinction is made between upper and lower case, for your convenience and comfort :smile:.<br />
When you hover over a character, the character's card is highlighted.<br />
When you click on a character's card, its detailed information will appear in full screen.<br />
