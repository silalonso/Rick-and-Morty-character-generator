# :rocket: Rick and Morty character generator :rocket:

This is my Rick and Morty character generator.<br />
You can use it, whether you are a human or an :alien:. One thing is for sure, you are going to :heart_eyes: it! <br />

Try it here : [Rick and Morty](https://beta.adalab.es/modulo-3-evaluacion-final-silalonso/)
![This is how the app looks like](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Adalab/modulo-3-evaluacion-final-silalonso/master/src/images/screenshot.jpg)

## How does it work?

The exercise consists of developing a web page with a list of Rick and Morty characters, which
you can filter by name.

First we paint on the screen a list of 20 characters, whose data we have obtained from: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Adalab/rick-y-morty/master/data/rick-y-morty.json <br />
![characters](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Adalab/modulo-3-evaluacion-final-silalonso/master/src/images/characters.jpg)

Then I've added an input to the interface, so that when you write a name, only the characters whose name contains the written letters(in that same order) remain visible.<br />
No distinction is made between upper and lower case, for your convenience and comfort :smiley:.<br />
When you hover over a character, the character's card is highlighted.<br />
When you click on a character's card, its detailed information will appear in full screen.<br />

## :wrench: To run this project

**You need to have Node.js installed** <br />
Clone or download the repository in your computer.<br />

To install local dependencies, type:

#### `npm install`

Also, you need to install React Route and SASS:

#### `npm install --save react-router-dom`

#### `npm install node-sass`

In the project directory, type:

#### `npm start`

This runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.<br />

Have fun! <br />
